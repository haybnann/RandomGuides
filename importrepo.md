#Importing a Private repo

#Github apparently doesn't like this and wont let you use your password to do this, so instead you need to create a personal access token.

- Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens 
- Generate a token
- Attempt to import your private repo
- Paste in the Private access token in place of your password
- Import should be a success.
